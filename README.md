# QuarterlyChallenge_FY24-Q4

## Summary

The challenge's goal is to work with a team to create a solution that will be presented at the end of the quarter.  The idea is to use your enablement time to collaborate with a team to help solve the use case.  You have been paired with a team with experience across our product's different pillars (Search, Security, and Observability).   This is an opportunity to get experience in different areas of the product and also explore the new and best ways to solve these problems.  There will also be a mock customer team that will help answer and guide the challenge along the way.  Any data sets or ways of exploring the solutions in Elastic will be shared with all the teams.

The challenge will be scored on the following:
The final presentation to the mock customer at the end.
The supportability of the solution.
Cost of implementation.
Incorporating new stack features into your solution.


Build a solution to support the following use case:
We are a medium-sized international commercial shipping company with a few different types of systems deployed in the cloud with Google Cloud.  From a security standpoint, we would like to see the Google Cloud audit logs in Elastic, along with Google Command Center findings and security sources.  From an observability standpoint, we would love to have more visibility into our application logs and understand how well our applications perform.  A majority of our systems are deployed using Jenkins.  We leverage Jenkins for our entire CI/CD pipeline.  We would like to have more monitoring and visibility into this area.  The applications that we deploy are mostly Java back-end services with Node and React front-end services. From a search standpoint, we have developed a set of how-to documents that help us solve issues with our applications, and we would like to leverage these when we see specific errors in our logs.  The idea would be to have one place to see issues and get information from our internal site data to see how we can more quickly get on top of customer issues.
